## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end Tod-List code base.

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. The designs are in JPG static format.
